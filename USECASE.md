Validate/Monitor access to network devices with the integration of Genie/pyATS, WebEx Messenger and Syslog server
=====================================
Exploiting Genie/pyATS for Validating/Monitoring access to network devices

__Check_Access__ Project leverages [Genie/pyATS](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/genie-docs/docs/cookbooks/index.html), [WebEx Messenger](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/genie-docs/docs/cookbooks/index.html) and [python logging module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) to efficiency Validate/Monitor access to network devices by displaying, sending the result to WebEx Messenger Space and triggering logs to Syslog server for information and maintenance purposes. 
The present project can be used for:
  - __Check__ access to network devices by periodic monitoring process
  - __Vlidate__ access to network devices prior provisioning/retrieving data process 
  - Separatly or integrated in CI/CD pipeline project in order to __Validate__ access to network device before starting the process.

***Keep in mind that this project is not to test connectivity, it allows to check access to network devices through their management interfaces.***
